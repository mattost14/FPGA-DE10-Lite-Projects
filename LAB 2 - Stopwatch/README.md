# DE10-Lite FPGA: Stopwatch Project

This is a simple Stopwatch implemented entirely in VHDL for the DE10-Lite Development Board using Quartus Prime.

The time is displayed using the six 7-Segment display.

The "reset" button is the Key(0).

The "go" button is the Key(1).

This project was part of the ECE 5730 - Reconfigurable Hardware class taken at the Utah State University (USU) in the Fall of 2023.
