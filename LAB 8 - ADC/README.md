# DE10-Lite FPGA: ADC

Build a DE10-LITE project that takes an ADC measurement at a 1 Hz rate. Display the ADC reading as hex values on the appropriate number of seven-segment displays.  Interface a potentiometer to the board and show the displayed value changing as the pot is adjusted.  Implement a reset button.
